## 1. Motivation
In classification problem, highly imbalance data might cause a lot problem.<br> I want to find out ways to deal with highly imbalance data, to get more TP, and higher f1-score.<br>
Recall = TP/(TP+FN) <br>
Precision = TP/(TP+FP) <br>
F1-score = 2 * Precision * Recall / (Precision + Recall)
