## Motivation
(Guan Ming Liu)
We want to predict the return of Bitcoin under the timeframe of 1-minute k-line with several technical indicators such as kd, rsi and obv. The mehtod would be some major machine learning algorithms.

- Rising Interest in Cryptocurrency: Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, have gained significant attention in recent years. The increasing adoption and the potential for substantial returns have made them a hot topic in the financial world. Understanding and predicting the returns of such assets is crucial for investors, traders, and financial analysts.

- Need for Data-Driven Decision Making: In financial markets, data-driven decision-making is becoming increasingly important. Traditional financial models are often unable to capture the unique characteristics of cryptocurrencies. This project offers an opportunity to explore how machine learning, which excels in handling large datasets, can be applied to gain insights into the Bitcoin market.

- Technical Analysis and Machine Learning Fusion: Combining traditional technical analysis, which is widely used in trading, with machine learning techniques is an exciting frontier. This project can demonstrate the power of integrating these two approaches to provide more accurate and actionable predictions.

- Potential for Investment and Risk Management: Accurate predictions of Bitcoin returns can be immensely valuable for investors and traders. Moreover, understanding the volatility and risk associated with Bitcoin investments is equally important. Machine learning can be a powerful tool in creating risk management strategies.

- Real-World Application: The application of machine learning to predict Bitcoin returns has real-world implications. It can help investors make informed decisions, traders optimize their strategies, and financial institutions better understand and manage their exposure to cryptocurrencies.

- Exploration of Technical Indicators: Technical indicators, widely used in trading, offer a wealth of historical data. Investigating how different technical indicators correlate with Bitcoin price movements can provide valuable insights into market behavior.

- Interdisciplinary Learning: This project brings together finance, data analysis, and machine learning, creating an opportunity for interdisciplinary learning. It can help students develop skills that are highly relevant in today's job market.

- Contributing to the Field: By conducting this research, you can potentially contribute to the growing body of knowledge on cryptocurrency markets and machine learning applications in finance. Your findings may help refine existing models and inspire further research in this exciting area.
