## Motivation

Cast as the sleepy, boring backwater of the capital markets, the bond market doesn't always get the attention it deserves. However, in the intricate landscape of financial markets, bond default prediction remains a pivotal aspect for investors, risk managers, and policymakers. The significance of accurately forecasting bond defaults cannot be overstated, as it directly impacts investment decisions and the stability of financial systems. Traditional approaches to bond default prediction have primarily fused on static financial indicators and historical data, often overlooking the dynamic nature of financial markets.
 
This research aims to bridge this gap by employing advanced machine learning techniques: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to enhance the predictive accuracy of bond default likelihood. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset of both defaulted and non-defaulted bonds across various time series, this study intends to uncover hidden patterns and temporal dynamics that traditional models might miss. The novelty of this research lies in its cross-sectional and temporal approach, analyzing how bonds' performance over time can signal impending defaults. The use of cutting-edge machine learning models adds a layer of sophistication, potentially leading to more robust and accurate predictions. These models are chosen for their proven effectiveness in handling large datasets and their ability to discern complex, non-linear relationships.

## Data and Methodology

For this study, we will be utilizing the TRACE (Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine) database as the primary source of our data. This database provides detailed records of bond transactions, including but not limited to transaction dates, prices, yields, and
volumes. It encompasses a wide array of bonds, offering a rich dataset for analyzing patterns and trends related to bond defaults.

Features will include basic information about the bonds such as issue date, maturity date, coupon rate, credit ratings, and issuer details. Historical transaction data from TRACE, including the price, volume, and frequency of trades, will be analyzed. This data helps in understanding the market perception and liquidity of the bonds over time. The fundamental attributes are crucial for understanding the baseline characteristics of each bond. Polynomial Features: Polynomial feature engineering involves creating interaction terms
and higher-degree features from the existing data. By incorporating polynomial features, we aim to capture more complex, non-linear relationships that might be present in the data. This approach is expected to provide deeper insights and uncover patterns that are not
immediately apparent from the basic features alone.
